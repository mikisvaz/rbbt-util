Enrichment
==========
When geting lists of genes through genomic positions, for instance genes
affected by mutations, gene clusters may brake de independence assumption of
the enrichment statistic. A rename scheme can be used to correct this. Genes
in clusters can be renamed to their cluster name so that they are only counted
once in the statistic. The enrichment for a term is computed counting once all
the cluster genes annotated for that term, and counting them as one in the
gene list only if there is an overlap.
